My project code from various tutorials I've done.

Links to sources:

The numbered projects, 1-13, are from the fantastic HTML and CSS tutorial site, "Interneting is Hard". Link: https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/

The dropdown menu project (named "dropdown") is from w3school's excellent tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp
