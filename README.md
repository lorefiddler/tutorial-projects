My project code from various tutorials I've done.

Links to sources:

The numbered projects, 1-13, and the "dropdown" project, are from the fantastic HTML and CSS tutorial site, "Interneting is Hard". Link: https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/

The hamburger menu project is from w3school's excellent tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_topnav_responsive.asp

The CAPTCHA project is from this tutorial: https://www.makeuseof.com/captcha-validation-html-css-javascript/
It's a good tutorial, but I decided not to use CAPTCHA on my website for accessibility reasons.
