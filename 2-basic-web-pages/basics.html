    <h1>First Website</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" (list item) element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
      <li><p>You can add a paragraph to a list, as long as it's nested within list tags</p></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Ordered lists are wrapped with an "ol" element</li>
      <li>The "li" element is the same
      <li>The numbers increment on their own</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements:</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes,</em> you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Sometimes you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize a word or phrase.</p>

    <p>You can also <em><strong>nest</strong></em> "em" and "strong" for more strongly emphasised text.</p>

    <h2>Empty Elements:</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Internetting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
